Introduction
===============================

cascading.utils is an open source set of utilities for Cascading workflows that we
use here at Scale Unlimited for the Bixo Java web mining toolkit and other projects.
There are classes that wrap Cascading Tuples with "datum" objects, a few utility classes
such as TupleLogger and SplitterAssembly, some classes to help monitor running
workflows, etc.

Building
===============================

You need Apache Ant 1.7 or higher. 

To get a list of valid targets:

% cd <project directory>
% ant -p

To clean and build a jar (which also runs all tests):

% ant clean jar

Note that "ant clean jar" will currently fail, due to a bug in the maven ant task
plugin used for managing dependencies.  After it does, execute the following commands
in order to replace the corrupt pom in your local Maven repository:

% rm ~/.m2/repository/net/java/jvnet-parent/1/jvnet-parent-1.pom
% mvn eclipse:eclipse
% ant clean jar

After this, subsequent builds should all succeed.

To create Eclipse project files:

% ant eclipse

Then, from Eclipse follow the standard procedure to import an existing Java project
into your Workspace.
